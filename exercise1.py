# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
# it will loop 20 times
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# if i is equal to 20, it will print "You got it".
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# range function range(1,20), will only loop from 1 to 19 (exclusive of 20)
